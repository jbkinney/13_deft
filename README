=== Instructions ===

All computations were performed using the Canopy Python Environment by Entought, available at https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/ 

The file "deft.py" contains all the density estmation routines of DEFT. Just copy this file to any directory in which you want to peform density estimation. 

To see a simple demsontration of DEFT in 1 dimension, run "demo.py"

To recreate Figs. 1 and 2, run "fig1_fig2_calculate.py", then "fig1_fig2_draw.py"

To recreate Fig. 3, run "fig3_calculate.py", then "fig3_draw.py"

To recreate Fig. 4, run "fig4_calculate.py", then "fig4_draw.py"
